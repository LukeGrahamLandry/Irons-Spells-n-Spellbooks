There's a bunch of stuff that uses newer vanilla content. Needs various levels of rethinking.
- frog (SummonedFrog)
- easy cauldrons with different fluids (BloodCauldronBlock)
- snow / freezing (need to either reimplement it or balance ice spells)
- amethyst (brewing mana potions)
- skulk particles (DeadKingCorpseEntity), warden sounds (HeartstopEffect)

More just random code changes I should revisit.
- places that used to use reducedTickDelay could call `Mth.positiveCeilDiv(int, 2);` directly if update frequency is important.
- which mouse input event is right?
- did biome/structure tags exist in 1.16?
- need some obsessive testing to make sure no asset/data json formats changed between versions
- scary that different places reference different versions of DefaultBipedBoneIdents. should go through and consolidate.

I haven't done any worldgen stuff. They change it so much every version I can never keep track.

Not touched yet but soonâ„¢
- player animator 1.16 didn't have first person
- overlay rendering
- projectile rendering to old model system
- port mixins
- register capabilities
- guis
- items
- blocks
- commands
- apotheosis integration
- tetra integration
- custom registries
- datafixers
    - but do they change vanilla stuff or only for fixing old mod worlds? might not need because nobody has an old 1.16 world.

Added a gradle script that makes the dev environment play nice with arm64 macOS.
It does nothing on other machines but feel free to remove.
